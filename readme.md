# BuyCoins Africa Coding Challenge
Using the GraphQL GitHub API (https://developer.github.com/v4/explorer/), recreate your github profile page (the tab that lists your repositories). 


## Contributing
To run the project locally:
 - create a fork of the repo and clone to your local computer
 - Open up your github [developer settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
 - Create a new token and copy the new token generated (Don't give more permissions than necessary)
 - Locate the `graphql.js` file in the `js` folder
 - Find the `github_options` object, replace the token property value with your newly generated token.
